Customization Tips

    Change your $mod key in config if Super isnâ€™t your thing.

    Swap out terminal (xterm) for alacritty, kitty, or your fave.

    Adjust workspace app assignments by modifying the assign lines.

    Enable compositor by uncommenting picom lines.

    Add your own scripts or launch apps by adding exec lines.

    Edit Polybar config for colors, modules, and position.
